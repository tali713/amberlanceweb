#+OPTIONS: toc:nil
* Quickstart
  - Make sure lein and a JVM are installed
  - Run =lein sass watch= to compile css whenever updated
  - Run =lein figwheel= to start a local development server
  - By default it will be available on localhost:3449

* Recommended
** Emacs
   Emacs can make working in Clojure and other lisp family languages
   much more pleasant, however any editor will work with figwheel,
   since it is triggered by file changes.
*** Packages
     If you have not already added melpa-stable to your package archive add
     the following to your .emacs

     #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (load-library "package")
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
                  '("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
     (package-initialize)
     #+END_SRC

     - cider :: Allows you to connect to a clojure session
     - paredit :: Structural editing made easy
     - highlight-parentheses :: Help visualize structure
     - clojure-mode :: Self explanatory

*** Suggested hook if above packages are installed 
    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp 
    (dolist (hook '(eldoc-mode paredit-mode
                    prettify-symbols-mode highlight-parentheses-mode))
      (add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook hook))
    #+END_SRC
